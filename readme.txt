*	Download any MySQL database in your cPanel account directly from this plugin.
*	Add a new MySQL database and a new MySQL user to that database.

With it (in time) you will be able to perform many convenient functions from within your WordPress site that

and also your crons.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the CONFIRM box all about? =

As you can imagine with great power comes great responsibility. This plugin lets you delete databases and users in bulk.

So, before I can let you do that, you must type in the word CONFIRM exactly as it is, in capital letters, each time you want
to perform a task. If you don't, the task will fail.

This is a small protection against accidental clicks etc. If you accidently delete all your databases and
you want to blame someone, you know that it could only have been done by typing CONFIRM and submitting the task. There's NO
way around this.

= Can I undo my delete of databases and users? =

No!

Use the MySQL database delete and MySQL user delete functionality with GREAT CARE. You are wholly responsible for any mess you create. 

= Where is all the documentation? =

The cPanel Manager is very easy to use right now because there isn't much functionality.

But, documentation is coming. I wanted to get this work out to the public first, [get feedback](http://worpit.com/help-support/?src=wporg "Worpit: Manage Muliple WordPress Sites Better")
and then move on from there.

= Do you make any other plugins? =

Yes, we created the only [Twitter Bootstrap WordPress](http://worpit.com/wordpress-twitter-bootstrap-css-plugin-home/ "Twitter Bootstrap WordPress Plugin")
plugin with over 20,000 downloads so far.

We also created the [Manage Multiple WordPress Site Better Tool: Worpit](http://worpit.com/?src=wporg) for people with multiple WordPress sites to manage.
